```markdown
## Design Considerations

The design of the **[My Application]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.
```

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------
```markdown
## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

```markdown
## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [After I finished my app, it wasn’t running although it didn’t have any errors]
   - **Solution**: [I asked Gemini what the issue was and I fixed my app according to what Gemini said the issue was ]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [My buttons and my TextViwes weren’t moving]
   - **Solution**: [I removed the constrains from my code so that I could move my buttons and my TextViews ]

8. Future Enhancements
----------------------

```markdown
## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [Allowing users to download the app]
2. **Feature 2**: [Showing the user what time they had inserted before]
3. **Feature 3**: [Allowing users to input what they are allergic to so that the app doesn’t suggest the food that the user is allergic to]

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
